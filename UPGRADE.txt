================================================================================
IMPORTANT: IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU BACKUP ALL YOUR OLD FILES AND DATABASE
BEFORE ATTEMPTING AN UPGRADE. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW HOW TO RESTORE YOUR BACKUP
JUST IN CASE THINGS GO WRONG.
================================================================================

================================================================================
Upgrading to the latest 2.1 from a previous 2.1 version.
================================================================================
Backup.
Upload all files overwriting old files.
You can also delete any old files that are no longer included if you'd like, for potential security fixes.
Don't delete /admin/temp, /pixels, /upload_files or config.php.
CSS files have moved to the css folder.
Resave the Main Config in MDS admin.
If you can't get there try to delete everything in the config.php file below the define lines. i.e. Everything below define( 'ERROR_REPORTING', 0 );
Log into the admin to merge language file updates into any language files from the default.

================================================================================
UPGRADING FROM 2.0.15 TO 2.1
================================================================================
No database changes in this release.

Once you have backed up your site (both database and files) overwrite the old
files with the new ones from the zip file you downloaded.

Any files you customized will be overwritten so don't overwrite any files you've
customized, merge them instead.

================================================================================
Upgrade instructions below are from previous versions of Million Dollar Script.
================================================================================

Basically, it is possible to upgrade your existing site
with this new version. Your database will be upgraded
automatically after uploading the files, when you go
to your Admin section.

The upload procedure is the same as in previous upgrades.

However, because the header and css files were modified
in version 2.0 - you would need to merge these files with
your existing files too.

The changes are too big to list right now.... 
The script's zip file more than doubled in size!

================================================================================
Upgrade instructions below are from previous versions of Million Dollar Script.
================================================================================

Upload all the files with the latest date, except:

- config.php 
- logo.gif
- users/header.php 
- users/footer.php 
- lang/english.php 
- main.css

The script will upgrade the database automatically once
you log into the Admin section.

The script will also update the language file(s) in the lang/ directory.
The script will warn you if it cannot write to these files.

NOTE: Backup your files and database tables before attempting an upgrade.
You can backup the database tables by exporting them as SQL in PHPMyAdmin.

NOTE 2: If you have customized any other PHP files, you will need to merge them.
We recommend this handy tool for the job (free):

NOTE 3: The html file mouse_overbox.htm was modified in this version and will need
to be uploaded. (We have added a 'filter: revealtrans();' to the CSS style definition)
